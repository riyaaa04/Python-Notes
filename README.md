# Python

- **About Python.**
- Python is a popular programming language.
- Python can be used on a server to create web applications , mathematics , software development.
- Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language
- It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
- • Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.
- 
-  Python Indentation.
- Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
- Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
- Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
- 
- Variables
- Variables are containers for storing data values.
- 

- 
  Data Types:
  Numeric Types:

  int: Integer data type.
  float: Floating-point data type.
  
  complex: Complex number data type.
  
  Sequence Types:
  str: String data type.
  list: List data type.
  tuple: Tuple data type.
  
  Mapping Type:
  
  dict: Dictionary data type.
  
  Set Types:
  
  set: Set data type.

  - Strings
- Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.
- 'hello' is the same as "hello".
- You can display a string literal with the `print()` function:
- 
- Python divides the operators in the following groups:

- Arithmetic operators
- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators
- Identity operators
- Membership operators
- Bitwise operators
-
**List**

---

Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are [Tuple], [Set], and [Dictionary], all with different qualities and usage.

Lists are created using square brackets:mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

List items are indexed, the first item has index `[0]`, the second item has index `[1]` etc.

Method	Description

append()	Adds an element at the end of the list

clear()	Removes all the elements from the list

copy()	Returns a copy of the list

count()	Returns the number of elements with the specified value

extend()	Add the elements of a list (or any iterable), to the end of the current list

index()	Returns the index of the first element with the specified value

insert()	Adds an element at the specified position

pop()	Removes the element at the specified position

remove()	Removes the item with the specified value

reverse()	Reverses the order of the list

sort()	Sorts the list

TUPLES

Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.tuples are immutable

Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are [List], [Set], and [Dictionary], all with different qualities and usage.

A tuple is a collection which is ordered and **unchangeable**.

Tuples are written with round brackets.

mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

Method	Description

count()	Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a tuple

index()	Searches the tuple for a specified value and returns the position of where it was found

Python Dictionaries

---

thisdict = {  "brand": "Ford",  "model": "Mustang",  "year": 1964}

Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.

A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.


**The __init__() Function**

All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.

Use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created:


# The self Parameter

The `self` parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belongs to the class.

File handling is an important part of any web application.

Python has several functions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting files.
