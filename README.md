- Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
- Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
- 
- Variables
- Variables are containers for storing data values.

  Data Types:
  Numeric Types:

  int: Integer data type.
  float: Floating-point data type.
  
  complex: Complex number data type.
  
  Sequence Types:
  str: String data type.
  list: List data type.
  tuple: Tuple data type.
  
  Mapping Type:
  
  dict: Dictionary data type.

- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators
- Identity operators

**List**

---

Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are [Tuple], [Set], and [Dictionary], all with different qualities and usage.

Lists are created using square brackets:mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

List items are indexed, the first item has index `[0]`, the second item has index `[1]` etc.
